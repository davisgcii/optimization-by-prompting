 A quick implementation of DeepMind's ["LLMs as Optimizers" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409).

## Usage

Feel free to download the notebook and play around with it. The code is pretty self-explanatory, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davisgcii).

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up a virtual environment -> `python3 -m venv env`
3. Activate the virtual environment -> `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install the requirements -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the notebook (I just run in VSCode, but you can run it however you want)
